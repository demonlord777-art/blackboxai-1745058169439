# AI App Builder

## Project Overview
AI App Builder is a web application that utilizes artificial intelligence to assist users in generating code snippets based on their prompts. This application aims to simplify the app development process by providing quick code generation functionalities through a simple user interface.

## Installation
To get started with AI App Builder, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-app-builder.git

## Usage
After starting the server, open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser. You will see a user interface where you can:

1. Enter a description of your desired app or code into the textarea.
2. Click on the "Generate Code" button to request AI-generated code.
3. The generated code will be displayed in the output area. You can copy the generated code by clicking on the "Copy Code" button.

## Features
